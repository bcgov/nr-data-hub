# Schema Validation Tool

This tooling takes in JSON documents and validates them against an expected schema structure.

## How to use locally

1. Install the latest version of `python` on your machine
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` from the root of this folder to install the required packages
3. Run `python3 main.py json_document_file target_schema_file` where `json_document_file` is the JSON document you wish to validate and `target_schema_file` is the schema definition file
