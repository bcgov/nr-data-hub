## POC 1: Data Product on AWS

- [ ] Identify the database and specific table we wish to use in POC
  
  - Discuss with the data architects best table to use for the POC, small, little or no PDFs?
  - Confirm with Annika which attributes we'll want for a POC, seen a doc on confluence for this, messaged her since!

- [ ] Write API application to write data from the source database to location in S3

    - Should be simple enough, operate on a cron or similar to query data and write the table into S3, could be done hourly during working hours or something
    - Deployed and provisioned via OpenShift
    - Destination should be a RAW delivery directory in the permitting domain bucket

- [ ] Plumb replication pipeline to processed S3 bucket

    - The easy bit
    - Use transformation logic defined by Vish and Abi
    - Deliver transformed data to another directory in the S3 bucket

- [ ] Expose output ports to downstream users

    - Simple implementation will be S3 files, could be extended to athena for SQL like queries
    - Files should be fine however

- [ ] Expose an observability port to downstream users

    - Health of data product, created from the health of constituent services
    - Unsure of implementation, likely a lambda
    - Logs would be good too, maybe even

- [ ] Expose a discoverability port to downstream users

    - DynamoDB for global URI of the data product
    - Expose some programatic documentation somewhere?
